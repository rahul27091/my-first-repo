<p>This Power BI project is structured around several key tasks designed to unlock the secrets of MovieLens's ecosystem In order to create the "Movie Talkies: Classic" edition, the challenge lies in effectively analyzing and presenting a wealth of information about movies from a bygone era. The core issue is understanding the characteristics of these classic movies, user interests, and the relationship between user demographics and movie ratings. Without clear visuals, it's difficult to identify patterns, draw meaningful conclusions, and engage the audience on a deeper level.:</p>
